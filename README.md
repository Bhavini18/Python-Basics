Basic operations on Python


Here i have explained all the examples involved in learning Python.
Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. 
Every variable in Python is an object.


Data Types in python: 
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set, frozenset
Boolean Type:	bool

String:
Slicing:You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
Slice From the Start
By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character
Slice To the End
By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end:
Negative Indexing
Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string



Python Loops
Python has two primitive loop commands:

while loops
for loops

The while Loop
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
The break Statement
With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true
The continue Statement
With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next

Python For Loops
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
Looping Through a String
Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters
The break Statement
With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items
The range() Function
To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 and ends at a specified number.

A lambda function is a small anonymous function.The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.
